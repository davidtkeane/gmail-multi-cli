## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

# Instructions How to Use.

A. gmail_multi_usr_bin.py   <-- This file will be sent to the /usr/local/bin/ folder so you can run gmail from the command line.>

B. gmail_ping_test.py       <-- This file must be in the same folder as gmail_multi.py and .env file to work.>  

This script will test the connections after you get your app password. # Change your name from Bob below in the script. Not below, but below on Line 39 and 40 in gmail_ping_test.py.

        # Get credentials from environment variables (BEST PRACTICE)
        # EMAIL_USER = os.getenv("EMAIL_USER_Bob")
        # EMAIL_PASS = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASS_Bob")

C. usr-bin.sh               <-- This script is to used for sending the gmail_multi_usr_bin.py to the /usr/local/bin/ folder so you can run gmail from the command line.>

D. how_to_use.md            <-- This File will help you setup gmail_multi_usr_bin.py to be able to run on the command line.>

# Note. Both gmail scripts need google user and password, the only difference is that the Bin version has the users and passwords inside the scripts while the gmail_multi.py saves the user names and passwords to a .env file for security. 
# The bin version is also secure, as you will need to use your password to save the files into the location, I did on my Macbook Pro m3. And anytime I change anything I have to enter my password. 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gmail-multi-cli.git
   cd gmail-multi-cli
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): 

   NOTE: I don't myself, but if you don't know what a virtual environment (venv) is then not need to do this.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up your `.env` file with your Gmail account credentials (see [Configuration](#configuration) section).

5. Install the modules needed to run the script Requirements.txt

   Locate a file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory with the following content:

   ```bash
   python-dotenv==0.19.2
   colorama==0.4.4
   ```

   Install requirements.txt

   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python gmail_multi.py
   ```
6. Congrats!


### Using App Passwords (Recommended for accounts with 2-Step Verification)

An app password is a 16-digit passcode that gives a less secure app or device permission to access your Google Account. App passwords can only be used with accounts that have [2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839) turned on.

[Create and manage your app passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). You may need to sign in to your Google Account.

If you’ve set up 2-Step Verification but can’t find the option to add an app password, it might be because:

* Your Google Account has 2-Step Verification [set up only for security keys](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523).
* You’re logged into a work, school, or another organization account.
* Your Google Account has [Advanced Protection](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7539956).

**Tip:** Usually, you’ll need to enter an app password once per app or device.

1. To create an app password, you need 2-Step Verification on your Google Account.
2. Go to your Google Account's App Passwords page: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)" from the dropdowns.
4. Enter a name for the app (e.g., "Gmail CLI").
5. Click "Generate".
6. Use the generated 16-character password in your `.env` file instead of your regular Gmail password.

**Note**: Keep this password secret and secure!

## Usage

After installation and setup, run the script:

```bash
python gmail_multi.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to:

1. Select an account
2. Choose an action (read new emails, check older emails, send an email, etc.)
3. Perform email operations

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Gmail account credentials:

The app password is 16  letter in length with spaces between every 4 letters, example fejylpueanyepjeb

So to add the password like this EMAIL_PASS_TheDude=fejylpueanyepjeb and this format works.

You will need to change you details in 
   1. The .env file see below for the format.
      (See a few lines below) 
   2. You will need to also change your names in the gmail_multi.py @ Line 87 'def select_account():' 
      (See a few lines below) 

1. The .env file

   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER_TheDude=your.email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS_TheDude=app_password

   EMAIL_USER_Man=another.email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS_Man=app_password

   EMAIL_USER_SpaceMan=third.email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS_SpaceMan=app_password
   ```
2. gmail_multi.py

   ```bash
   def select_account():
      print_ascii_gmail2()
      print(Fore.YELLOW + "\nSelect an account:")
      print("1. Bob")
      print("2. Man")
      print("3. Linky")
      print("0. Exit" + Style.RESET_ALL)
   ```

Replace the email addresses and passwords with your actual Gmail credentials.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Error**: Ensure you've enabled "Less Secure App Access" or are using an App Password.
- **Module Not Found Error**: Make sure you've installed all required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- **SMTP Connection Error**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.
